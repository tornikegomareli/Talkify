# Talkify: Swift Speech Recognition and Synthesis Library

Talkify is a Swift library designed to streamline the process of integrating speech recognition and synthesis capabilities into iOS and macOS applications. The library harnesses the power of native APIs such as SFSpeechRecognizer and AVSpeechSynthesizer, providing a high-level interface that simplifies their usage and handles common tasks, such as managing audio sessions and checking microphone permissions.

The primary component of Talkify is the TalkifySpeechRecognizer class. This class provides a comprehensive set of methods for managing speech recognition tasks. It establishes and manages an AVAudioEngine instance for audio operations, handles speech recognition requests and tasks, and provides delegate methods to keep your application informed about the status of speech recognition processes. It also integrates with TalkifyRecordingSession to facilitate the audio recording process.

# Why ?
Just to beat my procrastination ðŸ˜„

But it really aims to be a comprehensive solution for developers looking to incorporate speech recognition and synthesis into their apps. It abstracts away the complexity of the underlying APIs, allowing developers to focus on creating engaging user experiences.

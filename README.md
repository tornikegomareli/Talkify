## Privacy

Everything is on-device: Apple's `SpeechAnalyzer`/`SpeechTranscriber` for recognition, `AVSpeechSynthesizer` for Read Aloud. Talkify makes no network requests, stores no audio, and keeps no history beyond the local usage metrics you can see in Insights.

## Requirements

- macOS 26 (Tahoe) on Apple Silicon

## Install

With Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap tornikegomareli/talkify https://github.com/tornikegomareli/Talkify
brew install --cask talkify
```

Or grab [**Talkify.dmg**](https://github.com/tornikegomareli/Talkify/releases/latest/download/Talkify.dmg) from the latest release.

Build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tornikegomareli/Talkify.git
cd Talkify
open Talkify.xcodeproj   # ⌘R
```

Or headless:

```bash
xcodebuild -project Talkify.xcodeproj -scheme Talkify -configuration Debug build
```

Run the tests the same way CI does:

```bash
xcodebuild test -project Talkify.xcodeproj -scheme Talkify -destination 'platform=macOS'
```

## Using it

| Action | Gesture |
|---|---|
| Dictate | Hold **fn**, speak, release |
| Hands-free session | Quick-tap **fn**, speak, tap again to finish |
| Cancel mid-session | **Esc** |
| Read selected text aloud | **⌥ ⎋** (toggles; also in the menu) |
| Everything else | Menu bar ghost → Settings |

The trigger and the Read Aloud shortcut are rebindable in **Settings → Shortcuts**

## Architecture

Code is organized into folders, callbacks only flow one way from the main wiring point, and a pure reducer handles the state.

- `App/` — composition root, settings store, status item
- `Input/` — the global key event tap and recorded bindings
- `Dictation/` — the session machine (`DictationSessionMachine`, a pure tested reducer) and the speech/insertion services
- `HUD/` — geometry seams, the shell, the voice visuals, and all Metal shaders
- `ReadAloud/`, `Settings/`, `Insights/`

`CONTEXT.md` is the domain doc, decisions live in `docs/adr/`

## Roadmap

- **Live Captions & Meeting Transcripts** — ephemeral captions from a selected app's audio (Chrome, YouTube, meeting apps), and the saved, timestamped transcript as a separate action. The domain design already lives in `CONTEXT.md`; the recognition pipeline is ready for non-microphone audio.
- **Text cleanup** — optional on-device polishing of dictated text (fillers, punctuation) once the raw-insertion core is benchmarked. Version 1 deliberately inserts exactly what you said.
- **Snippets** — saved text blocks inserted by a spoken trigger word: say your trigger mid-dictation and the whole block lands instead.
